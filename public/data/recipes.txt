Simple Pancakes
In a large bowl, whisk together two cups of flour, two tablespoons of sugar, one tablespoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, beat two eggs and add one and a half cups of milk and two tablespoons of melted butter. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix. Heat a griddle over medium heat and add a small amount of butter. Pour quarter cups of batter onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown.

Add more soy sauce and a teaspoon of honey. Toss everything together and serve over steamed rice.
